A Visual Studio Code theme for the solana summer folks out there, just in time for the hackathon.

- All colors and styles can be overwriten using the normal VSCode methods: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/configure

- Currently we natively support Rust + JS however more are on the way, it will work for everything, just better with what i've done manually thus far :)
